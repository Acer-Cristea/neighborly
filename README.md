# Neighborly: OpenSource Town-Scale Social Simulation for Sims-Likes

Neighborly is a framework that simulates characters in a virtual town.
It takes lessons learned from working with
[*Talk of the Town*](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)
and gives people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more
opportunities for customization.

## Notes

### Non-Deterministic Behavior

The goal of having a seeded pseudo random simulation is so that users
experience deterministic behavior when using the same starting seed.
We try to remove all forms of non-determinism, but some slip through.
The known areas are listed below. If you find any, please make a new
issue with details of the behavior.
