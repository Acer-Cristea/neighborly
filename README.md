# Neighborly: OpenSource Town-Scale Social Simulation for Sims-Likes

Neighborly is a framework that simulates characters in a virtual town.
It takes lessons learned from working with [*Talk of the Town*](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)
and gives people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more
opportunities for customization.
